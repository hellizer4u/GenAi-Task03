# 🔁 Markov Chain Text Generator

Implement a simple text generation algorithm using **Markov Chains**. This project involves building a statistical model that learns the probability of a word or character occurring based on the previous one(s), and then uses this model to generate new, semi-coherent text.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of Markov chains for probabilistic modeling.
- Build a simple yet effective text generator using custom training data.
- Learn how to tokenize, build transition tables, and generate new sequences.
- Implement everything in a single Python script.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Standard Libraries Only)
- Jupyter Notebook or plain `.py` script
- `random` module for weighted choices
